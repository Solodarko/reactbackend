## 📱 Presentation Flow

### Opening (2-3 minutes)
```markdown
"Today I'm presenting our Unified Attendance Tracking System for Zoom meetings. 
This system combines real-time participant tracking with JWT authentication 
and provides comprehensive attendance analytics with an 85% threshold."
```

**Show:** System architecture overview

### Phase 1: System Introduction (3-4 minutes)
```markdown
"Our system handles two types of participant tracking:
1. Webhook-based (direct from Zoom)  
2. Token-based (authenticated users with JWT)
Both are unified into a single comprehensive system."
```

**Demo Commands:**
```bash
# Start the interactive demo
node live-presentation-demo.js interactive

# Follow the prompts step by step
```

### Phase 2: Live Participant Simulation (5-7 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Participants Joining
```markdown
"Let me show you participants joining the meeting in real-time..."
```

**What happens:** 
- Alice Johnson (excellent student) joins
- Bob Smith (good student) joins  
- Charlie Brown (poor attendance) joins
- Prof. Wilson (host) joins

**Highlight:**
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- JWT token authentication
- Student database matching
- Attendance status tracking

#### Step 2.2: Real-time Attendance Table
```markdown
"Notice how each participant appears immediately in our attendance table 
with 'In Progress' status, showing real-time duration calculations."
```

**Show:**
- Live attendance table
- Duration tracking
- Percentage calculations
- Status indicators

### Phase 3: Attendance Scenarios (4-5 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Early Departure
```markdown
"Now watch what happens when Charlie leaves early - 
his attendance will be marked as 'Absent' because he doesn't meet 
the 85% threshold..."
```

**Demonstrate:**
- Participant leaving early
- Final status calculation
- Real-time status update

#### Step 3.2: Late Arrival
```markdown
"Here's Diana joining late - the system handles late arrivals 
and calculates their attendance percentage from their actual join time..."
```

**Show:**
- Late participant joining
- Adjusted duration calculations
- Impact on overall statistics

### Phase 4: Final Results & Analytics (3-4 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Meeting Conclusion
```markdown
"As the meeting ends and participants leave, watch how the system 
calculates final attendance status for each participant..."
```

**Highlight:**
- Final attendance calculations
- 85% threshold application
- Comprehensive statistics

#### Step 4.2: Analytics Dashboard
```markdown
"Our system provides comprehensive analytics including:
- Total participants
- Present/Absent counts  
- Attendance rate
- Average session duration
- Meeting utilization metrics"
```

**Show:**
- Complete statistics table
- Attendance breakdown
- Performance metrics

### Closing (2-3 minutes)
```markdown
"This unified system provides:
✅ Real-time tracking for both webhook and token-based participants
✅ Accurate 85% attendance threshold calculations
✅ JWT authentication for secure user identification
✅ WebSocket real-time updates
✅ Comprehensive analytics and reporting
✅ Student database integration"
```

### 3. **JWT Authentication**
- Secure participant identification
- Student database integration
- Role-based access (student/admin)

### 4. **85% Attendance Threshold**
- Industry-standard attendance requirement
- Accurate percentage calculations
- Clear Present/Absent/In Progress status

### 5. **Comprehensive Analytics**
- Multiple statistical measures
- Meeting efficiency metrics
- Detailed participant breakdown

### 6. **Scalable Architecture**
- Handles both small and large meetings
- Efficient database operations
- Rate limiting and request queuing

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Server Not Starting
```bash
# Check if port 5000 is in use
netstat -an | find "5000"

# If blocked, change port in .env
echo "PORT=5001" >> .env
```

#### MongoDB Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify MongoDB is running
net start MongoDB

# Check connection string in .env
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/attendance_tracker" >> .env
```

#### Demo Script Errors
```bash
# Install missing dependencies
npm install axios jsonwebtoken socket.io-client

# Verify server is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

#### WebSocket Connection Failed
- Check firewall settings
- Verify Socket.IO is initialized
- Try running in different terminal

### Emergency Backup Plan
If technical issues occur:

1. **Show Static Screenshots**: Prepare screenshots of the attendance table
2. **Manual Walkthrough**: Explain the process without live demo
3. **Code Review**: Show key parts of the unified tracking code
4. **Architecture Diagram**: Focus on system design
